# DjStream - Every DJ's dream!

We are a non-centralized library and offer a private and personalized audio file database designed for DJs. Our users have access to upload audio and mpeg files.

- .mp3
- .mpeg
- .wav
- .mp4
- And other audio formats

Our core features include **Tracks, Edits, Uploads, Playlists**

### Tracks

This is our users' tracklist for all the tracks they own in their library.

- Users can add their tracks to use for their sets.

### Edits

This is their edit list for all the edits they create. Features include:

- Adding audio files
- Change tempo
- Add loops
- Alter pitch

### Uploads

This is our users' upload list for any audio files they have imported into the database.

### Playlists

This is a collection of all of our users' private playlists. Features include:

- Creating new playlists
- Adding tracks to existing playlists
- Updating playlist metadata such as name and description
- Share playlists

### STRETCH GOALS ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¿:

- User access to stream music from Spotify and add to their account
  - Use Spotify Dev account to get access and connect to the API to pull users' Spotify data
- Mp4 to mp3 conversion
- Vocal and instrumental extraction using:
  - Web Audio API
  - Spleeter, a Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow.
- Leaderboard for users: social media like interaction, people can vote on public uploads, somebody could have highest rated tracks/edits and show up on top. Uploads and be number 1 on leaderboard for content.
- Have a public feed for users to interact with other users content (algorithm?)
