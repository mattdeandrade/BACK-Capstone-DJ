Stretch Goals: 
account creation? time editing? 
leaderboard for users: social media like interaction, people vote on public uploads, somebody could have highest rated tracks/edits and show up on top. uploads and be number 1 on leaderboard for content.
Have a public feed for users to interact with other users content (algorithm?)
